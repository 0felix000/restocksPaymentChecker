A simple script to check if your Restocks.net sales have already been paid by checking your bank account logs.

- add your account credentials into account.json

- download your bank-account-log from the website of your bank, use the .csv format

afterwards you will see how much money in sales you are still missing, in items.csv you see all your sales, tagged if they are paid or not
